# World Population EDA Project

## Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a world population dataset using Pandas. The dataset contains demographic information about various countries across different time periods, including population figures, growth rates, and population density. The objective is to analyze the data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about global population dynamics.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Rank**: The global population rank of the country.
- **CCA3**: The three-letter country code.
- **Country**: The name of the country.
- **Capital**: The capital city of the country.
- **Continent**: The continent where the country is located.
- **2022 Population**: The population of the country in 2022.
- **2020 Population**: The population of the country in 2020.
- **2015 Population**: The population of the country in 2015.
- **2010 Population**: The population of the country in 2010.
- **2000 Population**: The population of the country in 2000.
- **1990 Population**: The population of the country in 1990.
- **1980 Population**: The population of the country in 1980.
- **1970 Population**: The population of the country in 1970.
- **Area (km²)**: The total land area of the country in square kilometers.
- **Density (per km²)**: The population density of the country (population per square kilometer).
- **Growth Rate**: The annual population growth rate of the country.
- **World Population Percentage**: The percentage of the world population residing in the country.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- **data/**: Contains the raw and cleaned world population dataset in CSV format.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks used for EDA and visualization.
- **visualizations/**: Output visualizations generated during the analysis.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
