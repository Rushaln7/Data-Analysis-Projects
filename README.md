## Data Analysis Projects

This repository showcases my data analysis projects, demonstrating my skills in exploring, manipulating, and extracting insights from various datasets. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find:

**Project Structure:**

* Each project resides in its own subdirectory within this repository.
* Project folders typically contain:
    * `data`: Raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.
