# Data Analysis Projects

This repository showcases my data analysis projects, demonstrating my skills in exploring, manipulating, and extracting insights from various datasets. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find:

## Project Structure:

* Each project resides in its own subdirectory within this repository.
* Project folders typically contain:
    * `data`: Raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.
    * `notebooks`: Jupyter Notebooks or scripts containing the analysis code.
    * `results`: Output files, visualizations, and reports generated by the analysis.
    * `README.md` (optional): A project-specific README providing more details about the project goals, methodology, and outcomes.
