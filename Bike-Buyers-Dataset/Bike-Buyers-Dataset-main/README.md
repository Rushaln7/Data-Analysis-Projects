# Bike Purchase Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves data cleaning and analysis using Microsoft Excel to determine the factors that influence a customer's decision to purchase a bike for travel. The dataset includes various attributes such as customer demographics, income, education, and occupation.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Marital Status**: Marital status of the customer
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Income**: Annual income of the customer
- **Children**: Number of children the customer has
- **Education**: Level of education attained by the customer
- **Occupation**: The customer's occupation
- **Home Owner**: Indicates whether the customer owns a home
- **Cars**: Number of cars owned by the customer
- **Commute Distance**: Distance the customer commutes
- **Region**: Region where the customer resides
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Purchased Bike**: Whether the customer purchased a bike

## Project Tasks

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
    - Cleaning the dataset by addressing duplicate rows, column value adjustment for visualization, correcting data types, creating new column (Age Brackets) using Nested IF for better visualization of data and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Analysis**:
    - Creating pivot tables to analyze how different factors such as average income, age, and customer commute influence bike purchases.

The average income was higher for males than it was for females for both customers who purchased bikes, and those who did not.

Adults ages 31-54 purchased more bikes than those both younger and older.

When a customer's commute was one mile or less, they bought more bikes. But in the 0–1 mile commute, the number of people who chose not to buy a bike was also the largest. Owing to the increase in bike purchases from clients with daily commutes of two to five miles, it is challenging to ascertain whether commute distance had a significant role in these purchases.

3. **Visualization**:
    - Developing dashboard visualizations to represent the findings in an easily interpretable manner.

## Key Insights

- Analysis of the data reveals trends and patterns, such as which gender or education level is more likely to purchase a bike.
- Understanding how marital status, income, and other factors affect bike purchases.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, creating pivot tables, and building dashboard visualizations.

## Analysis of the Bike Sales Dashboard

![Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ac3ebd2-ee4d-4edd-955d-45601956992f)

This dashboard shows a thorough picture of the performance of the bike sales, broken down by different consumer demographics and purchasing patterns. The following summarizes the main findings:
- **Customer Demographics**: Information on the region, occupation, education level, and marital status of customers is provided by the dashboard.
- **Average Income Per Purchase**: The bar graph illustrates that, in comparison to female consumers, male customers had a greater average income per purchase.
- **Customer Age Brackets**: The line graph shows a pattern where the majority of bike purchases are made by middle-aged customers (35–54).
- **Customer Commute**: The line graph examines the connection between the distance commuted and the acquisition of a bike. It's interesting to note that consumers who travel 0–1 kilometers make the most purchases.
- **Purchased Bike vs. Demographics**: For every demographic group, a comparison between "purchased bikes" and "not purchased bikes" is shown in each chart, enabling perceptive analysis.

Overall, this dashboard offers insightful information on consumer preferences and purchasing patterns, facilitating the development of successful marketing and sales strategies.
